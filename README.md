# MultiComponentSignals 
This is the repository of the 2023 Thesis submission "An investigation into multi-component warning colouration" completed by Christopher Irving. In this repository, the data, statistical coding and figures of the three chapters that made up this project is found. Each chapter is contained within it's own folder,

## 1 - Signalling Scoring Framework 
This folder contains the data, statistical coding and graphs for  *Spots  and  stripes? How common are redundant warning colour signals in Australian Lepidoptera*. The first chapter of the thesis. Within this folder you will get directed to the project folder, "Signalling Scoring Database"  which takes you the R Poject in it's entirety. This folder contains the project file, the two spreadsheets used in the analysis (butterfly_data) and (moth_data) and Figure 1 of this chapter.  The spreadsheets contain field guides of moths and butterflies respectively and have had their patterns on their wings and bodies reported and how likely the species is to be warning coloured was scored.

## 2 - Static and dynamic warning colours
This folder contains the data used in the systematic review for *Static and dynamic warning colours - a review of current methodology*.  As this was a literature review, there is only two datasheets, which were used in the systematic review. "Aposematism and warning colouration - Raw extraction.xlsx" is the excel spreadsheet that was taken off of Web of Science without any edits. "Systematic Review - Aposematism AND Warning colouration.xlsx" copies the author, and titles from the raw datasheet, and applies the meta analysis to each paper.  The first sheet contains the data used, where each paper was identified if it was relevant to the aims, what aspect of warning signalling was being measured*, notes and if it was static and dynamic. The second sheet contains the basic analysis that was used in the chapter, reporting the number of relevant studies, and how many were dynamic, static or when I was unsure of the condition of the prey item.  The third sheet contains the legend that was used as guidance to determine what was not relevant and what types of warning signal factors could be assessed*.


***Note: Quantification Type was not utilised in the final report due to relevance, and not every paper had it's warning signal factor reported** 

## 3 - Amata nigriceps
This folder contains the data, statistical coding and the generated figures for *The function of individual colour pattern elements in Amata nigriceps warning colouration*.  Within the Amata analysis folder, everything has been organised into "data", "output" or "R". The data file contains all spreadsheets used in the analysis. The data folders include:

- Amata Measurements - Contains the body and wing lengths used in the preliminary analysis.
- Chris Intereliability and Paige Intereliability - 15% of overrall image analysis was done by both analysers to test for differences in technique. 
- Insect Flight Cage - The raw data that contains the proportion of orange and black seen in each moth that was used in the Insect Flight Cage Experiment
- Tethering - The raw data that contains the proportion of orange and black seen in each moth that was used in the Tethering experiment
- Resting Spreadsheet - The raw data that contains the proportion of orange and black seen in each moth that was used in the resting photos

The R folder contains the project and the script that was used in the analysis of this chapter, all graphs produced went into the "output" folder.  The output folder contains the figures produced by the R code, which is Figure 5 and Figure 6, used in this chapter, and Figure C1 and C2 which will be in the supplementary material of the thesis.
